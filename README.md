# Edge detection

This repository represents BMP image edge detection using Parallel algorithms for course of Parallel programming.  

Idea of this project is to detect edges of BMP images using serial and parallel algorithms for image processing (mainly using Prewitt operator) and to compare the results (compare visual quality of detected edges and time of execution).  

This project was made in my second year of faculty during summer semestar. At that time I haven't been using git and GitHub and that is the reason why this first and one commit consists the whole project.
